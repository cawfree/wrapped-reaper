        <p>The REAPERâ€™S GAMBIT is an on-chain conceptual artwork, an ERC20 token that becomes non-transferrable after 64800 blocks (9 days). Collectors must send their tokens to a new address before the end of this period, or their tokens will remain in limbo. The nine days countdown starts when an address first receives tokens. No address can be used twice. Escape the Reaper for as long as possible in this marathon of death.</p>
